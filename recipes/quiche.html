        <p><h2>Description</h2></p>
        <p><ul>
            <li><strong>All-Purpose Flour:</strong> I do not suggest subbing plant based flours here! A 1 for 1 gluten free flour may work, but I’d recommend doing a trial run first.</li>
            <li><strong>Granulated Sugar:</strong> A tiny pinch of sugar balances out the flavors in the pie dough.</li>
            <li><strong>Salt:</strong>Much like sugar, salt helps balance the flavors in the pie crust. It also helps enhance all of the delicious flavors in the egg filling.</li>
            <li><strong>Butter:</strong> Be sure your butter is VERY cold; warm butter is enemy #1 when it comes to pie crust.</li>
            <li><strong>Ice Water:</strong> Simply add an ice cube to your water a few minute before you need it for this recipe and voila, you’ll have ice water.</li>
            <li><strong>Frozen Chopped Spinach:</strong> If you want to use fresh spinach, that should work fine. You’ll want to start with a large amount as it shrinks a lot when you cook it down.</li>
            <li><strong>Olive Oil:</strong> Use whatever you have on hand, it doesn’t need to be fancy!</li>
            <li><strong>White Onion:</strong> I love the taste of white onion in this quiche because it doesn’t overpower the other flavors. Shallots would also work nicely.</li>
            <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> You’ll need 6 large eggs for the egg mixture. I cannot suggest an egg substitution.</li>
            <li><strong>Heavy Cream:</strong> Do not sub milk or half-and-half for this ingredient!</li>
            <li><strong>Cornstarch:</strong> This is my secret ingredient for avoiding a watery quiche.</li>
            <li><strong>Cayenne Pepper:</strong> Don’t worry, this ingredient won’t make your quiche taste super spicy! It simply enhances all of the other flavors. In a pinch, you can use black pepper. Although you may want to add a little more in quantity.</li>
            <li><strong>Ground Nutmeg:</strong> If you have fresh nutmeg on hand, by all means, feel free to use it! Just be sure to finely grate it and don’t use more nutmeg than called for.</li>
            <li><strong>Gruyere Cheese:</strong> If you cannot find gruyere, I suggest using half Swiss cheese and half cheddar cheese. Sharp cheddar cheeses will give you the best flavor.</li>
        </ul></p>
        <p><h2>Steps</h2></p>
         </ul>
         <ol>
         <li>Place the frozen spinach in a large skillet or saucepan and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until thawed, about 3 to 5 minutes. Remove pan from heat and drain spinach in a fine mesh strainer, removing as much excess liquid as possible. Set aside until needed.</li>
         <li>Place the skillet back on the stovetop over medium heat. Add the olive oil and white onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion has softened and is becoming translucent, about 6 to 8 minutes. Do not let the onion brown. Transfer the cooked onion to a small bowl and set aside until needed.</li>
         <li>In a large bowl whisk together the eggs, heavy cream, cornstarch, salt, cayenne pepper, and nutmeg. Using a rubber spatula, fold in the cheese, about ¾ of the spinach, and the cooked onions. </li>
         <li>Pour the filling into the partially baked crust placed on a large baking sheet. Sprinkle the remaining spinach on top of the egg mixture, spreading it evenly on top of the quiche. </li>
         <li>Place the pan in the oven and bake for 45 minutes, or until the center is set and the crust is golden-brown. 
         <li> Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes before serving. 
       </ol>
